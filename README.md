# FSAE ROS2 Workshop

This repo is a fun and interactive learning resource made to teach others about
ROS2. This is not a fully comprehensive guide, and it is recommended the workshop
host already knows enough ROS2 in order to run it. Included is a set
of activities that a host can run with a group of people with readmes and
templated source code.
